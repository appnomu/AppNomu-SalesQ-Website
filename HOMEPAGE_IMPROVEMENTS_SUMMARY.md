**After:** Problem-focused section highlighting:
- ❌ **Lost Sales & Customers** → ✅ Automated CRM & SMS Follow-ups
- ❌ **Stock Running Out** → ✅ Real-time Inventory Tracking  
- ❌ **Wasting 15+ Hours Weekly** → ✅ AI-Powered Automation

**Impact:** Immediately shows visitors the pain points you solve, creating stronger emotional connection.

### 4. **Removed "Industries We Serve" Marquee**
